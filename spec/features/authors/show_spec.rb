# As a user,
# When I visit the Book Index Page,
#   Then I see each author's name is a link
# When I click the link
#   Then I am taken to an Author Show Page where I see the author with that id including the author's:
#   - name
#   - the title of each book they have written
#   - the average number of pages for all of their books
